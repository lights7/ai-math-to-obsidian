# Obsidian Plugin: Copy Ai Math into Obsidian

This is a simple plugin can copy ChatGPT and Grok's Math equations to Obsidian. 

It was forked from [Darko Pejakovic's Convert KaTeX to MathJax plugin]{https://github.com/pejakovic/obsidian-convert-katex-to-mathjax}, which can copy ChatGPT's KaTeX into Obsidian's MathJax.

---

## **Why This Plugin?**

  ChatGPT and other platforms often render mathematical expressions using [**KaTeX**](https://katex.org) or just Latex, while Obsidian uses [**MathJax**](https://www.mathjax.org) for mathematical notation. This discrepancy can lead to formatting issues when copying and pasting content.

This plugin eliminates the hassle by automatically converting either Latex or KaTeX expressions to MathJax, making it easier to integrate ChatGPT or Grok generated content or other KaTeX-based math into your Obsidian vault.

---

## **Features**

- **Default paste conversion**: Automatically converts Katex or Latex
- **Command Palette Actions**:
  - **Paste with conversion**: Manually paste KaTeX or Latex content with MathJax conversion applied.
  - **Convert current text file**: Convert all KaTeX or Latex expressions in the current note to MathJax.
  - **Convert all files**: Batch-convert Latex or KaTeX expressions in every markdown file across your vault.
- Easy toggle to enable or disable automatic conversion.
- Works seamlessly with clipboard operations.
